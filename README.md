## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can we have a Java Edition version of the Wizards?
Minecraft Java Edition does not have an add-on system that is comparable to Bedrock, so plugins like these would not work.

There are several other methods to add entities, blocks, or items into Minecraft Java Edition. To find the right method for you, visit the [Blockbench Quickstart Wizard](https://www.blockbench.net/quickstart/) and select **Minecraft: Java Edition**.


### Can we have a stairs preset in the Block Wizard?
Blocks like stairs are not possible to implement in Bedrock add-ons. Once there is an easy way to implement stairs, they will be offered as a preset in the Block Wizard, along with stairs.


### Why is option X not available to add in the Wizard?
All wizards are meant to generate a starting point for add-on content. They provide options for basic use-cases. If you want to add more complex tech, you can manually edit the generated add-on using VS Code or another editor.


### Where can I find the source code for the wizard plugins?
The code is currently not publicly available. This repository is intended as a place for information and issue tracking.


### Is Education Edition supported?
We are aiming for compatibility with Education Edition. If you notice a problem with compatibility, please open an issue in this repository.
Note that Education Edition is typically a few versions behind the main version of the game, so newer features won't be available straight away.
